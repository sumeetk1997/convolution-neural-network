CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK:

Dataset contains images of dogs and cats. Two datasets are available, one for training and another for testing. I have trained a convolution neural network using a single hidden layer containing 128 nodes using training set. I have used rectifier function for convolutional layer and sigmoid function for output layer.

We have to predict the output as dogs or cats from test set.
